# NASA Techrise Challenge Work

##Before Flight##

###Hypothesis###
Pollution is concentrated at lower altitudes, due to denser particles sinking. However, there is the possibility of environmental factors, such as thermal inversion, causing a different result. 

###Data###
* Determining the percentage of air pollution
* Detailed quantification of air pollution resulting in improved targeting/ scoping of possible solutions
* Determination of the percentage of air pollution that is below cloud level contributing to getting recycled into the hydrologic cycle and thereby to water pollution. 
* Correlation between living at higher altitudes and prevalence of lung cancer and other similar health implications.
* Qualitative implication of air pollution. This can be used to raise awareness and rally efforts to address air pollution, similar to: endangered species photo archive, glacial melt photographs, library of lost sounds of animals.

###Fun Issues###
* Working with computers
  * Video decoder issues
  * Memory issues - my computer can render videos stored on the hard disk drive, but not as reliably from an SD card
  * Writing Python programs, and subsequently, CircuitPy code that runs on the microprocessor
* Wiring up microprocessors and sensors
  * Including how MISO/MOSI ports and the I2C interface work
  * Handling multiple data streams with limited TX ports
  * Disassembling off the shelf products to extract individual components
  * Regulating circuits using pull-up resistors (more current is not always good!)
  * Soldering & heat shrink tubing
  * Wire stripping & tinning
  * Graduating from gobs of flux to clean connections
  * Painfully learning how not to burn myself again
  * Taking care of soldering implements
* 3-D printing
  * How to design 3-D models, accounting for printer limitations, supports and overhangs
  * 3-D printer issues such as print bed adhesion, extruder blockage, delamination
  * Sanding to make last minute adjustments to fit sharp 3-D printed corners in a rounded capsule
* Hardening for extreme pressures and temperatures
  * Most 3-D infill patterns canâ€™t handle decreased atmospheric pressures
  * Epoxy works, tape residue melts
  * Popsicle sticks absorb humidity and skew readings
