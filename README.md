# NASA Techrise Challenge Work

--Before Flight--

My research leads me to the following hypothesis: Pollution is concentrated at lower altitudes, due to denser particles sinking. However, there is the possibility of environmental factors, such as thermal inversion, causing a different result. Whether or not the project supports my hypothesis, it should should reveal important ramifications of air pollution, for example:
Determining the percentage of air pollution
Detailed quantification of air pollution resulting in improved targeting/ scoping of possible solutions
Determination of the percentage of air pollution that is below cloud level contributing to getting recycled into the hydrologic cycle and thereby to water pollution. This would also explain why pollution takes a while to be moderated.
Correlation between living at higher altitudes and prevalence of lung cancer and other similar health implications.
Qualitative implication of air pollution. This can be used to raise awareness and rally efforts to address air pollution, similar to: endangered species photo archive, glacial melt photographs, library of lost sounds of animals.

This has been an amazing learning experience, and I’m grateful to have had this opportunity. Here are some examples of concrete skills and technologies that I learnt, accompanied here with examples of involved realizations:
Working with computers
Video decoder issues
Memory issues - my computer can render videos stored on the hard disk drive, but not as reliably from an SD card
Writing Python programs, and subsequently, CircuitPy code that runs on the microprocessor
Wiring up microprocessors and sensors
including how MISO/MOSI ports and the I2C interface work
Handling multiple data streams with limited TX ports
Disassembling off the shelf products to extract individual components
Regulating circuits using pull-up resistors (more current is not always good!)
Soldering & heat shrink tubing
Wire stripping & tinning
Graduating from gobs of flux to clean connections
Painfully learning how not to burn myself again
Taking care of soldering implements
3-D printing
How to design 3-D models, accounting for printer limitations, supports and overhangs
3-D printer issues such as print bed adhesion, extruder blockage, delamination
Sanding to make last minute adjustments to fit sharp 3-D printed corners in a rounded capsule
Hardening for extreme pressures and temperatures
Most 3-D infill patterns can’t handle decreased atmospheric pressures
Epoxy works, tape residue melts
And of course, simple hacks such as:
Using popsicle sticks
